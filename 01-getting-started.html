<h1>Introduction to Reproducible and Dynamic Reporting</h1>

<p>2 Hours</p>

<hr />

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
<li>Discuss elements of a reproducible research report (also called &lsquo;executable research compendium&rsquo;)</li>
<li>Explore a real-life reproducible research report</li>
<li>Install R packages needed for this course</li>
<li>Render a provided reproducible report to HMTL, docx, and slides using Rstudio, Rmarkdown, and the knitr package</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>Has the research paper changed much in the last ~400 years?</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</em> first published in 1665</li>
<li>This first scientific journal established the important principles of scientific priority and peer review, which have become the central foundations of scientific journals ever since.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why static PDFs are an underwhelming use of today&rsquo;s technology</h3>

<ul>
<li><h4>There are 4 requirements of the Scholarly Record ^[Source: Rallison, S.P., &lsquo;What are Journals For?&rsquo;, <em>Ann R Coll Surg Engl.</em> 2015 Mar; 97(2): 89-91. DOI: 10.1308/003588414X14055925061397]</h4>

<ol>
<li>Registration of the author&rsquo;s claim</li>
<li>Certification that the research was conducted properly</li>
<li>Dissemination of the work to the right audiences</li>
<li>Preservation to ensure a permanent public record of the work that can be found and cited</li>
</ol></li>

<li><h4>We now have the tools to create a first class object that meets these 4 requirements and is also <strong>Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-Useable, and Reproducible</strong></h4>

<ul>
<li><h4>What are Reproducible research reports and why are they <strong>FAIR</strong>?</h4>

<ol>
<li>They are written in plain text which is universally portable and readable by humans and machines</li>
<li>They combine text explanations with code and dynamically generated figures, tables, and plots, all in one executable file</li>
<li>They replace static numbers, dates, and other values in the text with code that generates accurate and up-to-date values by the computer</li>
<li>They allow the author to work in the same environment used to write the code and generate the plots and tables</li>
<li>They allow the author to compose one report and then compile/render it to many different outputs, depending on the need</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>

<li><h4>Instructor Demo: Let&rsquo;s look at a reproducible report</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>We&rsquo;ll create our own in the next two days!</p></li>

<li><p>The first step in getting this dynmaic document is installing some software</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Software Installation</h2>

<p>R is a programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration,
visualization, and statistical analysis. To interact with R, we use RStudio.
For this workshop you&rsquo;ll need to install both R (version 3.4.3 or newer) and
RStudio on your computer.</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>Install R by downloading and running this
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm">.exe</a> file from CRAN.
Also, please install the <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">RStudio
IDE</a>.
Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the
installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select &ldquo;Run as administrator&rdquo;
instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later, for example when installing R packages.</p>

<h3>macOS</h3>

<p>Install R by downloading and running this
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg">.pkg</a> file from CRAN. Also,
please install the <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">RStudio
IDE</a>.</p>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<p>You can download the binary files for your distribution from
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/index.html">CRAN</a>. Or you can use your package
manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run sudo apt-get install r-base and for
Fedora run sudo dnf install R). Also, please install the <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">RStudio
IDE</a>.</p>

<h2>Workshop Files</h2>

<p>You also need to download some files for this workshop:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fork the GitHub repository at <a href="https://github.com/AuthorCarpentry/DTSTUDENT2018">https://github.com/AuthorCarpentry/DTSTUDENT2018</a> into your own GitHub account</li>
<li>Rename the Repository with your own name instead of &lsquo;STUDENT&rsquo; by clicking &lsquo;Settings&rsquo; at the top of the Repository GitHub page and typing in a new name</li>
<li>Use <code>git clone</code> to copy this repo to your desktop</li>
<li>Open the files in RStudio and let&rsquo;s get to work!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Intro to RStudio, Rmarkdown, and the knitr package</h2>

<p>Now open Rstudio (Applications/Rstudio).  Rstudio is the development
environment where we&rsquo;ll be working on our document.  The main panel you&rsquo;ll see
on the left is the Console, where you can run R code.  On the right is two
panels - the upper contains your environment (what R can access), and the lower
contains the files on your computer.</p>

<p>The first thing to do is install some packages.  RStudio makes it easy to
install new packages to do things you want.  You can find packages by going to
the &lsquo;Packages&rsquo; tab in the lower right panel.  You can install new packages by
clicking the Install button and typing in the package name.</p>

<p>For this lesson, we need the following packages:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>tidyverse</code></li>
<li><code>DT</code></li>
<li><code>rorcid</code></li>
<li><code>httpuv</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s actually work with a document.  Click in the &lsquo;Files&rsquo; tab in the lower
right panel of RStudio.  Let&rsquo;s find the <code>DTYourName2018</code> folder we cloned above.   You&rsquo;ll see
lots of files we will use during this lesson.  Double click on
<code>Base_2013_day1_in.Rmd</code>.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll see the document open in a new panel on the left hand side of the
screen.  In the top section of the document, replace the name with your own and change the date to today.</p>

<p>Knitting is a process in Rstudio that takes a text document and turns it into
an output (like html, docx, or html slides).  Now click the knit button in the upper
left hand corner of the editor.    The first
time you do this you&rsquo;ll get a message that you need to install some packages.
You&rsquo;ll want to click Yes and wait for the packages to install.  Once the
installation you&rsquo;ll see an interactive demonstration document!</p>

<p>You can output this single file in multiple formats.  By default we&rdquo;ve been&rsquo;ll be
generating .html files, but we can also output to a Word document.  If you
click on the downward arrow next to the knit button we see some default
formats.  Click on Word, and a Word document will appear.</p>

<p>While pdf is an option, this requires a TeX distribution which is complex to
install and beyond the scope of  this course.</p>

<p>You can also select other output forms that aren&rsquo;t listed in the <code>knitr</code>
dropdown.  Take a look at the document.  You&rsquo;ll see in the top a section called
<code>output</code> with sections under it like <code>html_document</code>.  If we change the top
output knit will produce a different result.  Try replacing <code>word_document</code>
with <code>slidy_presentation</code>.  This is a html presentation that you can use in
any web browser.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll continue working on this document to create a reproducible research report !</p>
